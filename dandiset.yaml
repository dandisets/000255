description: A three-dimensional (3D) concordance maps of cyto- and fiber architecture
  of the human brain, combining histology, immunohistochemistry, and 7-T quantitative
  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in two individual specimens. These 3D maps each
  integrate data from approximately 800 microscopy sections per brain, showing neuronal
  and glial cell bodies, nerve fibers, and interneuronal populations, as well as ultrahigh-field
  quantitative MRI, all coaligned at the 200-Âµm scale to the stacked blockface images
  obtained during sectioning.
